# AWS Serverless Daily Finance App

A cloud-native web application for tracking daily finances, built with a serverless architecture on AWS. This project demonstrates a 3-tier architecture (Frontend, Backend, Database) fully provisioned using **Terraform**.

## ☁️ Cloud Architecture & Tech Stack

This project leverages AWS Serverless services to ensure scalability, low cost, and minimal operational overhead.

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- **Terraform**: Manages the entire lifecycle of AWS resources (S3, Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, IAM Roles).
- **State Management**: Remote state stored in S3 (`daily-finance-tfstate-dev`) with DynamoDB locking (implied).

### Components
| Component | Technology | Description |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| **Frontend** | HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript | Static website hosted on **S3** with public read access. |
| **API** | Amazon API Gateway | REST API acting as the entry point for the backend. |
| **Backend** | AWS Lambda (Python 3.9+) | Serverless functions executing business logic (`Boto3`). |
| **Database** | Amazon DynamoDB | NoSQL key-value store for fast transaction lookups. |

⚠️ Note on Environment & Constraints This project was developed and tested within the AWS Learner Lab environment. Due to the platform's specific restrictions, certain architectural decisions were made:

Service Availability: Limited to a subset of AWS services (e.g., CloudFront and Route 53 were not used due to lab permissions).

IAM: All AWS services in this project operate under the permissions of the provided LabRole, due to environment constraints.

Session Management: Infrastructure was designed to be easily reproducible via Terraform to accommodate the 4-hour lab session limit.

## 🚀 Deployment Guide

### Prerequisites
- **AWS CLI** configured with appropriate credentials.
- **Terraform** (v1.5.0+) installed.
- **Python 3.9+** (for preparing Lambda zips).

### 1. Initialize Infrastructure
Navigate to the terraform directory:
```bash
cd terraform
terraform init
```

### 2. Deploy Resources
Review and apply the plan. This will create all AWS resources and output the API Endpoint.
```bash
terraform plan
terraform apply --auto-approve
```

### 3. Update Frontend Configuration
After deployment, Terraform typically outputs the **API Gateway Endpoint**. Update your frontend JavaScript configuration to point to this new URL.

### 4. Upload Frontend to S3
Upload your static files to the created S3 bucket:
```bash
aws s3 sync ../frontend s3://<YOUR_BUCKET_NAME>
```

## 🛡️ Security & Scalability features
- **IAM Roles**: Least privilege policies attached to Lambda functions (managed in `lambda.tf`).
- **CORS**: Configured in API Gateway and Lambda to allow cross-origin requests from the S3 website.
- **Auto-scaling**: AWS Lambda and DynamoDB (On-Demand mode) scale automatically with traffic.
